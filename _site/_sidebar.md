<!-- Paths are ROOT-ABSOLUTE (leading /) on purpose.
     `relativePath: true` in index.html resolves in-page links against the current page's
     directory — which is what makes the repo's own Markdown work unchanged. But the sidebar is
     rendered on EVERY page, so relative paths here break the moment you navigate into
     cmp-supabase-auth/: `TARGET_MATRIX.md` would resolve to /cmp-supabase-auth/TARGET_MATRIX.md.
     Absolute paths keep the sidebar correct from anywhere. -->
